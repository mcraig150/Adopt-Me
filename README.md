# AdoptMe

Pet Finder - Application to find and adopt pets in your. Search parameters to narrow down your search example: breed, color, health, etc. Option to pin/favorite animals and store them in a database for easy access in the future.


User Story: As a user, I'm looking for an application that will give me animals up for adoption based on the location I entered. After I search I am presented with basic information about the pet such as name and distance from me and a link to view more details on the pet. Each pet will have a favorites button for me to check and save that pet to view later.
